Place the project image `MindWellGarden.png` in this folder and commit it so it's available for the static site.

Recommended filename: MindWellGarden.png
Example commit steps:

1. Copy the PNG into the folder

   - Windows Explorer: drag and drop into `assets/images/`

2. In terminal:
   git add assets/images/MindWellGarden.png
   git commit -m "Add MindWellGarden project image"
   git push origin main

After pushing, GitHub Pages will serve `assets/images/MindWellGarden.png` and it will be visible on the site.
